Generalized Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction from adiabatic projection

This implements the methods of https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01359 "Systematically Improvable Generalization of Self-Interaction Corrected Density Functional Theory". Based on PySCF. 

apsic.py is methods for performing all calculations in that reference 

butene.tar.gz is input files for 2-butene torsion
